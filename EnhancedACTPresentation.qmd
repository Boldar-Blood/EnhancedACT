## Welcome & Session Goals

- **Why we’re here**
  - The ACT is rolling out an **Enhanced ACT** with **optional Science**.
  - Colleges and scholarships are responding in **different ways**.
- **Today’s focus (≈15 minutes)**
  - High-level overview of the **Enhanced ACT** (beyond just Science).
  - What’s changing for **ACT Science** and **STEM signaling**.
  - How key colleges — and **Florida Bright Futures** — are handling it.
  - How we, as a counseling team, can **advise families confidently**.
- **What you’ll leave with**
  - A simple **decision framework** for students.
  - A clearer sense of **when to recommend ACT Science**.
  - Clarity on **how and when to loop me in** for student questions.

::: {.notes}
This opening slide frames the session as high-level and practical.  
Emphasize that the Enhanced ACT is not just a Science tweak; it changes how scores are calculated and reported, which affects strategy, messaging, and scholarship planning.

Stress that we’ll:
- Give counselors a concise overview, not a deep psychometrics seminar.
- Focus on the practical “What should I tell this family?” questions.
- Hit Florida Bright Futures specifically because it’s new and affects many of our families.

Set expectations: about 15 minutes today, with this deck and notes available later for anyone who can’t attend or wants a deeper review.

## Big Picture: The Enhanced ACT (2025+)

- **Core structure**
  - **Three required sections**: English, Math, Reading (EMR).
  - **Optional sections**: Science (now optional like Writing) and Writing.
- **Scoring basics**
  - Composite ACT score now = **average of EMR only** (1–36).
  - Science is scored separately (1–36) and used with Math to form the **STEM score**.
  - ACT Superscore uses **EMR only**; Science does **not** affect Superscore.
- **Rollout timeline**
  - Digital/online Enhanced ACT: **April 2025 onward**.
  - Paper ACT transitions by late **2025**; legacy paper format retires.
- **Implication for us**
  - Students now have to **decide** whether to add Science.
  - Colleges & scholarships can choose **whether and how** to use the Science score.

::: {.notes}
This slide gives the high-level “what changed” beyond just Science:

- The Enhanced ACT shortens the test and simplifies the composite by focusing only on English, Math, and Reading.
- Science becomes optional but lives alongside Math in the STEM score.
- Superscoring has changed: ACT’s official Superscore ignores Science. This matters for how colleges see “best scores.”

Stress that:
- From a student/family perspective, ACT is no longer a single fixed package; it’s more customizable.
- From a counseling perspective, that customization introduces **new strategic decisions** and **new policy noise**.

You don’t need to recite timing minutiae; just make clear that:
- Spring 2025 = start of the new era.
- By the time current sophomores/juniors are testing, Enhanced ACT will be standard.

## What Changed in ACT Science?

- **From required to optional**
  - Previously: Science was **required** and part of the composite.
  - Now: Science is **optional**, scored separately, and **not** in the composite or ACT Superscore.
- **Format & role**
  - Still a **40-question**, data-analysis-heavy section (1–36 scale).
  - Pairs with Math to produce a **STEM score** that colleges may still value.
- **Reporting**
  - Students can register **with or without Science**.
  - Score reports show:
    - EMR scores
    - **Composite (EMR only)**
    - Science score (if taken)
    - STEM score (if Science is taken)
- **Key takeaway**
  - Science is **no longer “baked in”** to the composite — but it still exists as a **signal**, especially for STEM-leaning students and some scholarships.

::: {.notes}
Here, emphasize the “feel” of Science relative to students’ experience:

- The content and skills of ACT Science are largely unchanged: interpreting charts, graphs, and experimental setups, not long biology lectures.
- The big shift is **policy and math**, not the nature of questions.

Counseling implications:
- A weak Science score no longer drags down the composite or the ACT Superscore.
- A strong Science score can create a **nice STEM story**: strong Math + Science, good for engineering, pre-med, etc.
- Students may assume “optional” = “doesn’t matter.” Our job is to explain that optional means **colleges have choices**, not that Science is irrelevant.

If asked, you can briefly note that there is a small extra fee for adding Science, but the main concern is **time and fatigue** on test day.
:::

## Why Optional Science Still Matters

- **STEM readiness signal**
  - ACT’s **STEM benchmark** uses Math + Science to predict success in **first-year STEM courses** and persistence in STEM majors.
  - Higher Math/Science performance is linked to **better STEM outcomes**.
- **Predictive value**
  - ACT scores (with HSGPA) still add **predictive power** for college GPA and degree completion.
  - STEM courses often grade more stringently; strong Math/Science scores can help contextualize a transcript.
- **Practical implication**
  - Even though Science won’t raise the **composite**, a solid Science + STEM score can:
    - Strengthen applications for **engineering, CS, pre-med, and other STEM majors**.
    - Support scholarship or honors-program review that looks at **STEM indicators**.
- **Rule of thumb**
  - If **STEM is on the table at all**, Science is **usually worth taking at least once**.

::: {.notes}
Use this slide to push back gently against the “I hate science so I’ll just skip it” narrative, especially for younger students who might change their minds.

Key ideas:
- ACT’s own research shows that Math + Science performance matters for STEM success, and they built a formal STEM benchmark around that.
- Colleges and programs that care about STEM will keep looking at **both** Math and Science if they’re available.

How to phrase it to families:
- “Even if Science doesn’t change the composite, it can still tell a helpful story if your student is aiming at anything math- or science-heavy.”
- “If there’s any chance of STEM, we want that option open rather than closed.”

You can also point out that a good Science score **never hurts**; now that it doesn’t drag down the Superscore, it’s mostly upside.

## What Colleges & Common App Are Doing

- **ACT’s stance**
  - Science is now **“student choice”**; colleges can **require, recommend, ignore, or superscore** it as they see fit.
- **Common App**
  - Starting with the 2025–26 cycle, students can self-report:
    - An ACT **with Science** *or*
    - An ACT **without Science**
  - This signals broad acceptance of both reporting paths.
- **Elite colleges (current examples)**
  - **Harvard**: “The optional science portion of the new ACT is **not required**.”  
  - **Stanford**: ACT’s optional Science section is also **optional for Stanford**.
  - **Princeton**: Accepts the redesigned ACT; Science is **optional** for the new test version.
- **Bottom line**
  - Many highly selective schools are **comfortable** with ACT submissions without Science.
  - But **programs and scholarships** can still have **stricter expectations** than the general admission office.

::: {.notes}
This slide reinforces that “optional” is real at many top schools:

- Harvard, Stanford, Princeton, and others have gone on record that the optional ACT Science section is not required for their applications.
- Common App supporting ACT with or without Science is a strong signal that schools are prepared for both types of score reports.

However, stress the nuance:
- “The college” may not require Science, but **specific programs** (engineering, nursing, pre-health, selective STEM honors) might still strongly prefer or expect it.
- As policies evolve, you’ll maintain a shared tracking document so the team doesn’t have to chase every nuance alone.

Keep it simple in your talk, then let counselors read the notes and references if they want more detail.

## Select Private Universities: ACT Science Policies

| School | SAT/ACT required?* | How they treat ACT Science (new exam) |
| :---- | :------------------ | :------------------------------------- |
| **Boston University** | Test-optional through Fall 2028/Spring 2029 | If you submit ACT, BU **requires Science** to be included in the report. |
| **Columbia** | Test-optional (current policy; see site) | Accepts new ACT **with or without Science**; students choose whether to send scores at all. |
| **Cornell** | Testing required starting Fall 2026 | Science **not required**; ACT composite based on EMR. |
| **Duke** | Test-optional | Science **encouraged** for STEM but **not required**. |
| **Harvard** | Test-required; see current policy | Optional Science **not required**; any ACT version accepted. |
| **MIT** | Testing required (SAT or ACT) | Science **not required**; ACT Writing also not required. |
| **Northwestern** | Test-optional (current cycle) | Science **optional**; composite and superscore follow EMR-only approach. |
| **Penn** | Testing required for 2025–26 | ACT Science **not required** for ACT submitters. |
| **Stanford** | Testing required (with hardship waivers) | ACT Science **optional**; accepts original and redesigned ACT. |
| **Vanderbilt** | Test-optional through Fall 2027 | Science **not required**; if submitted, used **only when it raises** the ACT superscore. |
| **Yale** | Requires testing (test-flexible: SAT, ACT, AP/IB) | ACT Science & Writing **optional**; ACT super-scoring allowed. |

\*Always verify each school’s current first-year policy on its testing page.

::: {.notes}
This slide shows **patterns**, not a static forever-list:

- Many selective privates **do not require** Science; a few (like BU) still require it if a student chooses the ACT route.
- Some schools (e.g., Vanderbilt) use Science only if it **helps** the superscore.
- Yale and similar schools have **test-flexible** structures where ACT Science is explicitly optional.

How counselors can use this in practice:
- For a student targeting BU or any school that **requires** Science, that’s easy: they **must** test with Science.
- For a student targeting only schools that treat Science as optional, you can think strategically:
  - STEM? Add Science.
  - Non-STEM, weaker in Science? Possibly skip, once you’re sure of their final list.

Remind the team that policies are moving and we’re tracking them in a shared spreadsheet. The slide table is a snapshot; the real power is in knowing the question to ask on each college’s testing page.

## Select Public Flagships & Systems

| School / System | SAT/ACT policy* | ACT Science treatment |
| :-------------- | :-------------- | :-------------------- |
| **UC (all campuses)** | **Test-free** for admission | ACT/SAT not used for admission; may be used later for **placement** only. |
| **Ohio State (Columbus)** | Testing required for many first-year applicants | Composite and any superscore based on **EMR**; Science not required. |
| **University of Florida** | Testing required (SAT/ACT/CLT) | Science **optional**; UF superscores using **English, Reading, Math only**. |
| **University of Georgia** | See page for current state policy | Will **not require** Science; aligns superscore to **EMR only**. |
| **UIUC (Urbana-Champaign)** | Test-optional | No separate Science requirement stated; ACT review focuses on EMR. |
| **UT Austin** | Testing required | Accepts ACT **with or without Science**; if Science is present, that composite may be reviewed. |

\*Always confirm the most recent admission cycle’s policy on the university site.

::: {.notes}
This slide emphasizes large public patterns:

- The **UC system** is test-free, so ACT Science is irrelevant for admission but can show up later for placement.
- Several big flagships (OSU, UF, UGA) have aligned with ACT’s EMR-only composite, explicitly not requiring Science for admission.

Important nuance for Florida students:
- Florida public universities (like UF, FSU, etc.) follow state guidance that **does not require** ACT Science for admission.
- However, for **Bright Futures**, the way Science is handled in the composite can matter for the scholarship — which we cover on the next slide.

Encourage counselors to:
- Check each school’s testing FAQ for phrases like “Science optional,” “composite based on English, Math, Reading,” or “we require all ACT subscores.”
- Flag any confusing or contradictory language and send it to you for interpretation.

## Florida Bright Futures: ACT Science Flexibility

- **New rule (starting with 2025–26 graduating class)**
  - For **Bright Futures**, the ACT Science section is now **optional**.
- **How Bright Futures calculates the ACT composite**
  - If ACT scores **with Science** are reported:
    - Composite = (English + Math + Reading + Science) ÷ 4.
  - If ACT scores **without Science** are reported:
    - Composite = (English + Math + Reading) ÷ 3.
  - Bright Futures uses the **highest section scores** across sittings.
- **What this means in practice**
  - Students can qualify for scholarships **with or without Science**, depending on which route yields the **higher composite**.
  - Florida public universities themselves **do not require** the Science subsection for admission.
- **Talking point for Florida families**
  - “Bright Futures lets you use whichever ACT combination (with or without Science) gives you the **stronger composite** — we’ll plan your testing to keep both options open.”

::: {.notes}
Here, explicitly connect to what the COO asked for:

- Bright Futures now formally allows ACT composites built either with EMRS or just EMR, using the best subscores.
- That effectively means students can “use or not use” Science, whichever gets them to the needed scholarship cutoff.

How to explain it to families:
- “If you take ACT with Science, Bright Futures will average all four subscores.”
- “If you take ACT without Science, they’ll average three subscores.”
- “They’ll use your best section scores overall. We’ll look at both pathways and see which composite helps you reach the Bright Futures threshold.”

Key counseling takeaway:
- For Florida students, taking ACT with Science **at least once** keeps the scholarship route flexible.
- If Science ends up being a weakness, Bright Futures policy gives us a way to ignore it; if it’s a strength, we take advantage of it.

## Counseling Framework: Should My Student Take ACT Science?

1. **Clarify likely majors**
   - Interested in **engineering, CS, data science, health, or “maybe STEM?”**  
     → **Recommend ACT with Science** (at least once).
   - Solidly **non-STEM** (humanities, arts, some business) and clearly non-STEM college list?  
     → Science becomes more **optional**.
2. **Check college & scholarship policies**
   - Use a **shared spreadsheet** with columns:
     - Test required/optional?
     - ACT Science required/recommended/optional?
     - Superscore rules and STEM program notes.
3. **Consider test-day strategy**
   - Strong EMR but **limited stamina** or test anxiety?
     - For non-STEM students with no Science requirements: consider **skipping Science**.
   - Unclear major or evolving list?
     - Take ACT **with Science at least once**, then decide about later sittings.
4. **Revisit before senior-year registrations**
   - Before final test dates, confirm:
     - College list policies
     - Scholarship requirements (especially **Bright Futures** and institutional merit)
   - Adjust plan accordingly.

::: {.notes}
This slide is designed as a scriptable decision tree:

- Start with **major/interest**: STEM interest almost always pushes toward including Science.
- Then move to **policies**, not vibes: What do the colleges and scholarships actually say on their websites?
- Next, fold in **student stamina and stress**. For some non-STEM students, a shorter test may be a real benefit.
- Finally, remind counselors that a student’s list and interests **move over time**; what’s clear in 10th grade may be different by 11th.

Encourage counselors to:
- Use the spreadsheet as the “single source of truth” so they’re not each reinventing the wheel.
- When something on a college website is ambiguous (“may consider STEM components”), send it to you for interpretation and to update the shared notes.

## Examples: How This Plays Out

- **Case 1: Florida student, STEM-curious**
  - 10th grader in Florida, likes **biology and math**, unsure between pre-med and psychology.
  - Target list includes **UF, FSU, UCF**, and a couple of out-of-state public flagships.
  - Counseling recommendation:
    - Plan for ACT **with Science** early.
    - Track both **Bright Futures thresholds** and **STEM program expectati**
